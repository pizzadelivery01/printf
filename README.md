## Week 7 - C - printf

### In this project learning objectives are:

#### General

Authorized functions and macros
- write (man 2 write)
- malloc (man 3 malloc)
- free (man 3 free)
- va_start (man 3 va_start)
- va_end (man 3 va_end)
- va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
- va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

#### Compilation

Your code will be compiled this way:
- $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c
As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)
Our main files will include your main header file (holberton.h): #include holberton.h
You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.
