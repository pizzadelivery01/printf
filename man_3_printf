.B _printf

- formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS

#include "holberton.h"

.SH DESCRIPTION

The

.B_printf()

produces output according to a format as described.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.TP

.BR c

The  int argument is converted to an unsigned char

.TP

.B s

The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character; if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no null character need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating NUL character.

.TP

.B %

A  `%'  is  written.  No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is `%%'.

.TP

.B d,i

The  int    argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that  must appear;  if  the converted  value  requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1.  When 0  is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

.SH RETURN VALUE

Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (not including the trailing `\\0' used to end output to strings).
