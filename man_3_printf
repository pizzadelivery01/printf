.SH NAME

.B _printf
- formatted output conversion.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include ``holberton.h''

int
.B _printf
(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B _printf()
produces output according to a format as described. The
.B _printf()
function write output to stdout, the standard output stream.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.TP

.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char

.TP

.B s
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating NUL character; if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no null character need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating NUL character.

.TP

.B %
A  `%'  is  written.  No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is `%%'.

.TP

.B d,i
The  int    argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that  must appear;  if  the converted  value  requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default precision is 1.  When 0  is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

.SH RETURN VALUE

Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (not including the trailing `\\0' used to end output to strings).

.SH EXAMPLES

To print a date and time in the form ``Sunday, July 3, 10:02'', where
.I weekday
and
.I month
are pointers to string:

    #include "holberton.h"\,
    _printf("%s, %s %d, %d:%d\\n"\,, weekday, month, day, hour, min);
